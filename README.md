# ðŸ¦„ Ethereum Metrics Exporter ðŸ¦„

> A Prometheus metrics exporter for Ethereum execution & consensus nodes

Ethereum client implementations expose extensive Prometheus metrics however there is minimal standardization around the metrics structure. This makes observability across multiple clients a painful experience. This exporter hopes to help alleviate this problem by creating a client-agnostic set of metrics that operators can run without any additional configuration to dashboards or alerting.

To provide these client-agnostic metrics the exporter relies entirely on these well-defined APIs:
- Execution clients
  - [JSON-RPC](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)
- Consensus clients
  - [Beacon Node API](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/)

This means that the exporter is limited to metrics that are exposed by these APIs.
